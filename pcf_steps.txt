Steps to push application to PCF
==================================

1. You must first have PCF account to continue with the next steps. Create account @ https://login.run.pivotal.io/
2. Once you are done with creating PCF account, go to your root folder of angular-starter application
3. Build production ready files via `npm run publish` in command prompt, (you can also do with dev ready files)
4. These command must output files to 'public' directory in root of app
5. Now copy all the files from 'pcf_settings' to 'public' (this is where your production ready files are built)
6. Open command prompt pointing to public directory
7. Run 'cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io', login to your pcf account using your credentials
8. Run 'cf push -f manifest.yml' and you must be seeing app starts uploading
9. Goto applications dashboard in PCF, open your app and click route URL provided by PCF.

HAPPY CODING.
