Steps to push application to PCF
==================================

1. You must first have PCF account to continue with the next steps. Create account @ https://login.run.pivotal.io/
2. Once you are done with creating PCF account, go to your root folder of angular-starter application
3. Build production ready files via `npm run publish` in command prompt, (you can also do with dev ready files)
4. Above command must output files to 'public' directory in root of app
5. Now copy all the files from 'pcf_settings' to 'public' (this is where your production ready files are built)
6. Open command prompt pointing location to public directory
7. Run 'cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io', now login to your pcf account using your credentials
8. Run 'cf push -f manifest.yml', now you must be seeing app starts uploading message
9. Now goto applications dashboard in PCF, open your app and click route URL provided by PCF.

HAPPY CODING.
